# Script: create-cloudberry-demo-cluster.sh
# Description: Creates and configures a demo Apache Cloudbery cluster.
#             Performs the following steps:
#             1. Sets up required environment variables
#             2. Verifies SSH connectivity
#             3. Creates demo cluster using make
#             4. Initializes and starts the cluster
#             5. Performs comprehensive verification checks
#
# Required Environment Variables:
#   SRC_DIR - Root source directory
#
# Optional Environment Variables:
#   LOG_DIR - Directory for logs (defaults to ${SRC_DIR}/build-logs)
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - Apache Cloudberry must be installed (/usr/local/cloudberry-db)
#   - SSH must be configured for passwordless access to localhost
#   - User must have permissions to create cluster directories
#   - PostgreSQL client tools (psql) must be available
#
# Usage:
#   Export required variables:
#     export SRC_DIR=/path/to/cloudberry/source
#   Then run:
#     ./create-cloudberry-demo-cluster.sh
#
# Verification Checks:
#   - Apache Cloudberry version
#   - Segment configuration
#   - Available extensions
#   - Active sessions
#   - Configuration history
#   - Replication status
#
# Exit Codes:
#   0 - Cluster created and verified successfully
#   1 - Environment setup failed
#   2 - SSH verification failed
#   3 - Cluster creation failed
#   4 - Cluster startup failed
#   5 - Verification checks failed
